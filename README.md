# D&D_ML_CR_Generator

Here is a ML algorith that was trained on 700+ DND(5e) monsters
The program predicts CR using the 8 other stats of the monster
AC, STR, DEX, INT, WIS, CON, CHA, and HP

When playing D&D people use custom mosnsters some times and this does not come with the challange rating the other monsters come with when published in offical literature.
(A challange rating (CR) is the average level a party of four players should be to have a medium to easy time defeating the monster)

By filling out the monsters_query.csv file with the stats of your custom monster it will predict appropriate CRs for each line and give you the accuracy score it recieved on its  training
